          Other than as provided for in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose or
          share your Personal Information if we notify you and we have obtained
          your consent for the disclosure or sharing.

            retention of Personal Information by such means and we have no
            responsibility to you for the same. We shall not be liable for any
            such retention of your Personal Information. You agree to indemnify,
